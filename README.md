# This project is deprecated

This crate is now deprecated. If you were using it and would like to update, please visit the page
of [luminance].

> Why did this crate get deprecated?

Mostly because [luminance] is now a standalone project (no backend involved). It enables the library
to be more concise by narrowing its scope and provide a well-defined interface instead of a blurred
set of mixins.
